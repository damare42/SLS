# SLS (Service, Learn, and Sustain)
Project
For this project, you will create a tool that stores projects and courses which are related to SLS
(Service, Learn, Sustain).

  The following sections contain a functional description of the system along with some mockup 
screens. Each section would explain a particular functionality and then present an example 
screen about it. You don’t have to follow the UI designs, but your program needs to support 
all the functionalities. These mockups are just for helping you to understand all the 
functionalities. A complete reorganization of the user interface is permissible as long as your 
application supports all the functionality listed below.

  The sections have been grouped by customer’s functionalities and managers’ functionalities. 
For heavy option, you may implement the project as a traditional standalone application (e.g., 
using Java GUIs) or as a web application (e.g., using a web scripting language like PHP). 
There is no restriction on the choice of language (e.g,. Java, Python, Javascript). We will also 
send an announcement about which languages/tools/software/platforms are allowed later this semester.
